# OpenStack Deployment 

Welcome to the documentation repository for our OpenStack deployment project! This repository contains detailed instructions, configurations, and screenshots for deploying a multi-node OpenStack environment using RDO (Red Hat Distribution of OpenStack).

## Project Description

This project involves the manual installation and configuration of a multi-node OpenStack environment using RDO. OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that provides a range of services for building and managing public and private clouds. Our deployment includes key OpenStack services such as Nova (compute), Neutron (networking), Glance (image service), and Keystone (identity service).

The main objectives of this project are:

- To create a scalable and resilient cloud infrastructure using OpenStack.
- To gain hands-on experience with the deployment and configuration of OpenStack services.
- To provide comprehensive documentation to facilitate future maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

Below are some screenshots showcasing the deployed OpenStack environment:
